# How-to set up a Discord Bot:

#### You will first need to set up a Discord Bot user through the Discord developers website and then selecting "My Apps". You can also follow this link [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me?). 

1. To create a new application, select "New App".
2. Click "Create App".
3. Remember the Client ID, as you will need this in order to invite your bot to your Discord channel later.
4. Click the "Create a Bot User" button, you will receive a prompt in which you should select "Yes, do it!" and then your page should update.
5. Also make note of your token as this is required to allow you to execute your code through your newly created bot user. Most open source bots should have a configuration file which you are meant to paste this into, but in some you may need to paste this directly into the code. Be sure to look up your bots documentation for more information.
6. We can now invite our bot to our Discord channel! Replace CLIENT_ID in this URL with your bot's Client ID that we made a note of earlier
